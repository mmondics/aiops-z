When it comes to microservices, one of the most helpful tabs in the Application perspective is the Dependency graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Dependencies tab.</p> <p></p> <p>The dependency graph offers a visualization of each service in the Application perspective, which services interact with each other, and visual representations of errors, high latency, or erroneous calls.</p> <p></p> <p>There are more tabs in the Application perspective related to each individual service, error and log messages, the infrastructure stack related to the tag, and options to configure the Application perspective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click through each of the tabs.</p> <p>If you pay attention while clicking through these tabs, you will notice that the payments service has an unusually high number of erroneous calls, and you could dig into the specific calls to start debugging these errors.</p> <p>Next, you'll take a look at Instana's Kubernetes monitoring capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Platforms -&gt; Kubernetes option in the left side menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the atsocpd1 (cluster) hyperlink.</p> <p></p> <p>OpenShift clusters are monitored by simply deploying a containerized Instana agent onto the cluster. Once deployed, the agent will report detailed data about the cluster and the resources deployed on it. Instana automatically discovers and monitors clusters, CronJobs, Nodes, Namespaces, Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Services, and Pods.</p> <p>The Summary page shows the most relevant information for the cluster as a whole. The CPU, Memory, and Pod usage information are shown. The other sections, such as \"Top Nodes\" and \"Top Deployments\" show potential hotspots which you might want to have a look at.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Nodes tab.</p> <p>The Nodes tab shows all of the Kubernetes nodes in the cluster in real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Namespace tab, then search for <code>robot-shop</code> and select it.</p> <p></p> <p>In the <code>robot-shop</code> namespace page, you can see details for all of the Kubernetes resources that are deployed in the <code>robot-shop</code> namespace, including deployments, services, pods, and the relevant metrics for each object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Platforms -&gt; IBM Z HMC option in the left side menu.</p> <p></p> <p>Instana supports monitoring IBM Z and LinuxONE hardware metrics and messages via the IBM Z Hardware Management Console (HMC). </p> <p>In the Instana console (and in the screenshot above), you should see two separate HMCs. HSYSHMA is managing a single DPM-mode IBM Z machine, while WSCHMC is managing three classic/Prism-mode IBM Z machines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the hyperlink for WSCHMC</p> <p></p> <p>This page shows you high level information about the IBM Z or LinuxONE machines themselves, including number of partitions, adapters, IP addresses, Machine Type Models and Machine Serial numbers.</p> Pop Quiz - Which system is a z14, which is a z15, and which is a z16? <ul> <li>QSYS: z14 (machine type 3906)</li> <li>FSYS: z15 (machine type 8561)</li> <li>KSYS: z16 (machine type 3931)</li> </ul> <p>You may notice that there are only a small number of partitions and adapters listed for each system. This is due to the fact that Instana only displays the objects (LPARs, adapters, channels, etc) that a specific zHMC userid has access to. If you want to add or remove visibility to certain objects in Instana, you do so by managing the zHMC userid just as system administrators already do.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the hyperlink for KSYS</p> <p></p> <p>You can now see the overall system utilization as well as that of individual processors. </p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the \"Environmental And Power\" tab</p> <p></p> <p>Instana provides the ability to monitor your environmental and power metrics, including Temperature and Power Consumption. Many clients migrate workloads from distributed/x86 platforms to IBM Z in order to reduce power consumption and thus their carbon footprint. With the metrics on this page, you can measure the impact that these migrations have.</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the \"Partition\" tab and expand one the KOSP3A option.</p> <p></p> <p>KOSP3A and KOSP3B are the names of the Logical Partitions (LPARs) where the OpenShift on IBM Z cluster is running. With this page, you can monitor the power consumption and processor usage for specific LPARs. This is useful for organizations who would like to see which applications or environments most contribute to power consumption. </p> <p>In the next section, you will look at infrastructure metrics. In our case, the metrics related to a Linux server with an Oracle Database installed on it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Infrastructure option in the left side menu.</p> <p></p> <p>The Infrastructure map provides an overview of all monitored systems. Within each group are pillars comprised of opaque blocks. Each pillar as a whole represents one agent running on the respective system. Each block within a pillar represents the software components running on that system.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Infrastructure search bar, enter <code>oracledb</code>. Two pillars will be returned, representing two different Oracle Databases running on Linux on IBM Z. Select the pillar for OracleDB @acmeair.</p> <p></p> <p>You can now see information about the Oracle on IBM Z database monitored by Instana including its version, SID, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the \"Open Dashboard\" button for the OracleDB.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you see metrics specific to Oracle that a database administrator might be interested in.</p> <p>There are many IBM Z technologies supported by Instana, including z/OS. See the list of supported technologies here, here, and here</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Analytics option in the left side menu.</p> <p>Instana analytics are integrated into each of the panels you've looked at so far, but you can also directly access them from the menu.</p> <p>By default, you're taken to a built-in dashboard for analytics related to Application calls. You can filter by using the left side options, or by creating filters at the top.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expand the left side options and select Only Erroneous and the robot-shop application.</p> <p></p> <p>The primary source of errors is starting to become apparent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Events option in the left side menu. Click the Incidents tab if you aren't automatically taken there.</p> <p>Instana can parse all of the requests, calls, traces, and other information into a stream of events and then classify and group them. Instana includes built-in events, predefined health signatures based on integrated algorithms which help you to understand the health of your monitored system in real-time. If a built-in event is not relevant for the monitored system, it can be disabled. Conversely, you can create a custom event in Instana if it does not already exist. These events can then be sent as an alert to a channel of your choice, such as email, Slack, AIOps, Splunk, PagerDuty, Prometheus, a generic webhook, or one of many more supported technologies.</p> <p>Right now you're looking at Incidents that Instana has identified during the timeframe. Incidents are created when a key performance indicator such as load, latency, or error rate changes over a certain threshold.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select the Issues tab.</p> <p></p> <p>An issue is an event that is triggered if something out of the ordinary happens. You can think of Incidents as Issues that Instana has correlated with each other to form a cohesive event.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"labs/instana-lab/#using-instana-to-identify-a-problem","title":"Using Instana to Identify a Problem","text":"<p>As you looked through the various sections of the Instana dashboard, a few errors kept popping up.

These new users can have their access scoped to certain environments, applications, or specific entities on the Turbonomic server so people can only access what they need to.</p> <p></p> <p>The first thing to notice is the supply chain on the left side of the page. Turbonomic uses the concept of a supply chain made up of buyers and sellers all with the goal of meeting application resource demand. The supply chain shown on the homepage includes all the entities that Turbonomic identified based on deployment of the KubeTurbo operator on the OpenShift on IBM Z cluster. The relationships and interdependencies between each entity were automatically identified and provide an overview of how each object relates to one another.

In OpenShift terms, this means adjusting the resource requests and/or resource limits applied to the application pods. The reverse is also important - if a container is overprovisioned - it has too much CPU or memory assigned to it - these resources are going to waste. Overprovisioning is a common issue in the containerized world, and it leads to inefficient use of resources, lack of resources for other applications that need it, and wasted money.   Horizontally Scale Containers - Scale up the number of pods for a microservice (click to expand)  If there is a Service Level Objective (SLO) configured for a containerized application, Turbonomic can scale the number of pods up or down in order to meet the demand at any given moment.  An APM solution such as Instana is required for this action type. Turbonomic needs metric data from the APM about response time and transactions speeds in order to enforce SLOs.   Pod Moves - move a pod from one node to another (click to expand)  Turbonomic continuously moves pods based on node resources available. The moves are performed in a way that keeps the application available throughout the move. Once executed, Turbonomic will start a new pod on the destination node -&gt; ensure that it is running and ready -&gt; deletes the original pod. This way, there is no perceived downtime to the application end user.   Cluster Scaling - Provisioning or Suspending OpenShift Nodes (click to expand)  Turbonomic will also generate actions to create new nodes in the OpenShift cluster or suspend existing nodes based on its analysis of efficiency (consolidating workloads onto fewer nodes) and performance (avoiding node congestion).  For OpenShift on IBM Z, Turbonomic will only *recommend* actions related to cluster scaling. Turbonomic relies on OpenShift machine autoscaling which is not supported on IBM Z. Therefore, if a node provision/suspension action is generated for an IBM Z cluster, administrators will need to perform that action themselves with manual methods and then Turbonomic will see that change."},{"location":"labs/turbonomic-lab/#manually-executing-actions","title":"Manually Executing Actions","text":"<p>As you saw throughout the tour of the Turbonomic platform, there pending actions related to some sample applications running on the IBM Z cluster.</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the OpenShift console, navigate to your <code>userNN-project</code>, click the icon for the NodeJS application, click the Actions dropdown, and then select Edit Resource Limits.</p> <p></p> <p>These are the default NodeJS application resources.
